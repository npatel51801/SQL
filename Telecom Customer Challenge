--In this database, I will query a telecommunications company database for information about the company's products and customers.

-- 1. I will write a query that selects the customer id of all the customers who are subscribed to Cell Phone service products.

--Inner query will display the product id for products that have “Cell Phone Service” as a product type.

Select product_id
FROM products
WHERE product_type='Cell Phone Service'
;

--Outer query: I will need a WHERE query that will search customer ids and the products_id column. 
--SELECT customer_id 
--FROM customer_subscriptions 
--WHERE product_id IN () 

--I have joined both queries to find the customer id's that fall under the product type of subscriptions to cell phone services.  

SELECT customer_id 
FROM customer_subscriptions 
WHERE product_id IN (Select product_id
FROM products
WHERE product_type='Cell Phone Service')
;


-- 2. I will write an query that will select the email address of all the customers with the "Internet" product type.

--Inner query 
SELECT product_id
FROM products 
WHERE product_type='Internet'
;

--Outer query
--SELECT email
--FROM customer_subscriptions 
--WHERE product_id IN ()

--Here I will combine both inner and outer query
SELECT email 
FROM customer_subscriptions 
WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id
FROM products
WHERE product_type='Internet');

--3. I will now write a query that will select the emails of all customers who are paying more than the average price for internet
--To do this, I need to calculate the average monthly price for internet, and then compare that against the customer price. I will integrate both inner and outer queries to find this data. 

--First, I will calculate the average monthly price of ALL product types. 

Select AVG(monthly_price) 
FROM products 
;

--Now, I will submit another query (inner) to calculate the average monthly price of products that are limited to internet services.

SELECT AVG(monthly_price)
FROM products 
WHERE product_type='Internet'
;

-- Now, I'll submit another query to retrieve all customer emails subscribed to any services
SELECT email 
FROM customer_subscriptions 
;

--Finally, I’ll combine the queries to find customer emails for those paying above the average monthly cost of internet-only services.

SELECT email 
FROM customer_subscriptions 
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(monthly_price)
FROM products 
WHERE product_type='Internet')
;

--Results are anita.davis@example.com and l.j.metzger@example.com
